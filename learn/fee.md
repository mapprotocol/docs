As an omnichain network infrastructure designated for omnichain dApps, MAP Protocol is destined to nurture a prosperous ecosystem for as many $MAP users as possible.  The critical success factor for MAP Protocol is to implement a simple yet cost-optimized revenue model. 

MAP Protocol ***will only charge the gas fee* produced on MAP Relay Chain for each cross-chain transaction**. Maintainer can get extra rewards from MAP Protocol for updating and maintaining Light-Clients.

As an inter-chain messenger program, Messenger is an essential part of MAP Cross-chain Services. Messenger needs to prepay the gas fees of MAP Relay Chain and the destination chain for omnichain users, which cannot be estimated in a decentralized way. Thus MAP Protocol opens the Messenger SDK to developers. Application Layer provides the flexibility for dApp developers to determine the cross-chain transaction fee standard, rewards to messengers, and their entry requirements. 

Vault & Data deployed on each chain are also essential parts of MAP Cross-chain Services, responsible for managing assets (fungible tokens and NFTs)  and data on each chain. For developers of Vault & Data, MAP Cross-chain Services will not charge any fees. Applications can determine the fee structure for sharing the liquidity in vaults and data pools at their discretion.
