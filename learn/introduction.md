# Introduction to MAP Protocol

MAP Protocol is an omnichain infrastructure for BTC, stablecoins, and tokenized assets swap. It provides the essential omnichain infrastructure for achieving interoperability among blockchain-based assets, storage, and computing across EVM and non-EVM chains.

## Key Features

- **Security-Finality**: Guarantee blockchain-level security through an independent self-verification network formed by light clients on every public blockchain.
- **All-Chain Coverage**: Embed heterogeneous chains' signing and hashing algorithm into the EVM layer of the MAP Relay Chain to ensure seamless communication between all chains.
- **Instant Confirmation**: Inter-chain communication programs and on-chain smart contracts work together efficiently to ensure that speed is only related to each chain's block time.
- **Minimum Cost**: MAP Protocol only charges the gas fee of MAP Relay Chain and other related chains with no additional cost.
- **Developer-Ready**: Through MAP Omnichain Service (MOS) deployed on and between public chains, dApps can share the liquidity of MOS's Vaults on different chains.

## Unique Characteristics

- **Omnichain Interoperability**: MAP Protocol allows point-to-point cross-chain interoperability between EVM and non-EVM chains.
- **Security Enhanced by Bitcoin Network**: The MAP Protocol leverages the security mechanisms of the Bitcoin network to protect the relay chain, using light client self-verification features to secure cross-chain transactions.
- **Distributed Trust**: MAP Protocol is decentralized, with no single entity in control, and all participants rely on the code for operations.
- **Flexibility**: The protocol allows the integration of different types of blockchains, including those with different signature schemes, hash algorithms, and Merkle proofs.
