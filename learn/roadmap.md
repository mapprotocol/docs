### 2019.Q3 - 2020.Q4

- Release MAP Protocol v1.0, implement cross-chain solution with light-client verification without relay chain.

### 2021.Q3

- Launch MAP Relay Chain Makalu Testnet, start the ligth-client veification cross-chain between MAP Makalu and Ethereum.
- Launch MAP Omnichain Service (MOS) for testnet.
- Start maintainer mining, invite users to participate maintainer test.

### 2022.Q1

- Support more chains decentralized cross-chain.
- MOS supports cross-chain between Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain and MAP Makalu.
- Invite more DeFi projects to join Makalu testnet.

### 2022.Q2

- Launch MAP Relay Chain, support more signature, hash, mining and Merkel proof calculation precompiled contracts.
- Launch the explorer and PoS DApp.
- Provide SDK to interact with MAP Relay Chain.
- Provide MOS SDK test version.

### 2022.Q3

- Extend cross-chain connections to Ethereum(EVM PoW) and Near(non-EVM PoS), which represents the technical mechanisms in blockchain space.
- Launch MAP Omnichain Service, support cross-chain fungible tokens and provide shared vaults.

### 2022.Q4

- Extend cross-chain connections to Ethereum(PoS).
- Extend cross-chain connections to popular EVM compatible chains: BNB Chain, Polygon, etc.
- Provide MOS SDK to develope individual MOSs.
- Support cross-chain bridge and swap DApps.

### 2023.Q1
- Extend cross-chain connections to popular EVM compatible chains.
