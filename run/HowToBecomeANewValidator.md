## Introduce

Map is a chain using POS consensus algorithm，Its working principle is as follows
- Become a validator by pledging a map
- Each validator votes to elect the validator of the verification block of each epoch
- At the end of each epoch, get rewards according to the vote of the election

## Prerequisites

### Hardware requirements

1. Machine configuration

    MAP is a Proof Of Stake network, which has different hardware requirements than a Proof of Work network.
Proof Of Stake consensus is less CPU intensive, but is more sensitive to network connectivity and latency.
Below is a list of standard requirements for running Validator on the MAP Network:

    - Memory: 16 GB RAM
    - CPU: Quad core 2.5 GHz (64-bit)
    - Disk: 256 GB of SSD storage, plus a secondary HDD desirable
    - Network: At least 100 Mb input/output Ethernet with a fiber Internet connection, ideally redundant connections and HA switches

2. Number of maps

   Your account needs to have at least 1,000,000 MAP

### Software requirements

Building atlas requires git, Go (version 1.14 or later) and a C compiler. You can install them using your favourite package manager.

## How to become a new validator

In order to make your assets safer, we need you to set some necessary identification parameters to become a validator. 
We also set the corresponding threshold so that we can screen those who really want to contribute to the chain. 
Of course, we will give corresponding rewards to these people.

The following steps are regarded as your first operation, because you only need to perform the following operations 
once to become a validator. Unless you log off the validator or cancel the corresponding operation, you will not need to 
perform the second operation to avoid wasting your gas fee.

### Step 1: create account

In this step, you need to transfer your identification information to the corresponding management contract,
which will manage your account, keys, and metadata.

The purpose of this step is keep your locked `MAP` more secure by authorizing alternative keys to be used for signing 
attestations、voting、validating. By doing so, you can continue to participate in the protocol while keeping the key 
with access to your locked `MAP` in storage.

You need `createAccount` command to perform the above operations,more detail about `createAccount` command 
please to see [this](/develop/map-relay-chain/marker/AboutCommon.md#createaccount).

### Step 2: authorize

Authorizes an address to sign consensus messages on behalf of the account. This authorized address is called the signer.
As his name is, he is only responsible for signing, your reward will not be issued to the signer, 
but to the account created in the previous step。

### Step 3: locked `MAP`

The threshold we set to be the validator is to lock 1000,000 `MAP` into the corresponding management smart contract.

This part of the locked `MAP` will be used for future punishment, which is also one of the conditions for being elected.

You need `lockedMAP`  command to perform the above operations,more detail about `lockedMAP` command 
please to see [this](/develop/map-relay-chain/marker/AboutCommon.md#lockedmap) .

### Step 4: validator register

This step is a key step for registering as a new validator.

You need `register`  command to perform the above operations,more detail about `register` command please to see [this](/develop/map-relay-chain/marker/AboutValidator.md#register).

At this step, you will successfully register as a validator. Next, you can try to vote for yourself. How to vote please to see[this](/develop/map-relay-chain/marker/AboutVote.md#vote).

### Step 5: vote

Validators must have at least 0.001 proportion of the total votes to be considered for the election. So the validator can't have no votes.

We can use our validator account to vote for ourselves, or we can let other validators or voters vote for ourselves.

We've locked in 1,000,000 MAP in step 3, and it's a great decision to vote for ourselves now

## Example

### Start A node that provides RPC services.

You can start a node that provides RPC services by yourself, or you can use the [RPC nodes](/develop/map-relay-chain/Makalu-PoC/PoC-2.md#atlas-address) we provide.

- Clone repositories
```shell
cd /Users/alex

git clone https://github.com/mapprotocol/atlas.git && cd atlas
```

- Build
```shell
make atlas
make marker
```
The file generated by build is in the build/bin directory

### Join the network
First, you need to prepare two keystore, one for staking is called account, and one for mining is called signer

keystore of `account`: UTC--2022-06-14T05-46-17.312327000Z--73bc690093b9dd0400c91886184a60cc127b2c33

keystore of `signer`:  UTC--2022-06-14T05-46-48.450557000Z--98efa292822eb7b3045c491e8ae4e82b3b1ac005

How to build the atlas [click here](/develop/map-relay-chain/make-private-chain.md#build-four-nodes)

If you want node to run in the background and not hang up,  you can use `nohup` and `&` in combination, or `screen` or similar. Below we will demonstrate using `screen`

--miner.validator is used to specify the address of the `signer`

```shell
./atlas --datadir ./node --syncmode "full" --port 30321 --v5disc --mine --miner.validator 0x98efa292822eb7b3045c491e8ae4e82b3b1ac005 --unlock 0x98efa292822eb7b3045c491e8ae4e82b3b1ac005

After the node starts, it will automatically connect to other nodes, and then start to synchronize blocks.

### Verify
So far we have completed the registration steps of validator, now let's verify whether it has become a validator.

```shell
./marker getTotalVotesForEligibleValidators -rpcaddr http://127.0.0.1:7445

INFO [07-08|15:10:03.301] Validator:                               addr=0xeA9efaA232A4567EaC21C8C096f8BfF84595A244 vote amount=1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

```
As can be seen from the above results, we have become a validator. But our vote count is 0, which prevents us from being 
elected as a validator that can participate in the block, which is not what we want. So we also need to vote for validators.

### Vote
The number of votes cannot be greater than the number of votes locked.

Judging from the results, I've successfully voted for myself, but it's not enough.
We need to call RPC in the next epoch to finally determine whether we are selected as validators who can participate in 
block generation，Just like the following:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"istanbul_getValidators","params":[],"id":1}' http://127.0.0.1:7445

# Output
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": [
        "0xb4e1bc0856f70a55764fd6b3f8dd27f2162108e9",
        "0x7a3a26123dbd9cfefc1725fe7779580b987251cb",
        "0x7607c9cdd733d8cda0a644839ec2bac5fa180ed4",
        "0x65b3fee569bf82ff148bdded9c3793fb685f9333",
        "0x98efa292822eb7b3045c491e8ae4e82b3b1ac005" # our signer
    ]
}
```
