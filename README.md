# Introduction

MAP Protocol is the omnichain layer of Web3, a cross-chain interoperable protocol to empower Web3 apps to thrive in the omnichain future. 

Today’s blockchain developers are building applications on multiple competing and non-interoperable blockchains, resulting in inefficient operation, low user resources, and high costs. The future is omnichain. The omnichian infrastructure is the powerhouse enabling all-chain interoperability and onboarding the next billion Web2 users into Web3.

MAP Protocol offers the provably secure omnichain infrastructure built upon Light-Client and Zero-Knowledge technology. There are four core pillars to MAP Protocol's omnichain infrastructure:
1. Full chain coverage: expandable and decentralized MAP Relay Chain to support both EVM and Non-EVM chains connections
2. Self-verifiable Light-Client: light-Client technology to verify all cross-chain transactions with definite and unambiguous results
3. Advance ZK Technology: Zero-Knowledge technolgy to optimize and speed up verification process and reduce transaction costs
4. Comprehensive SDKs: MAP Protocol Service (MOS) and SDKs to offer built-in interoperability features for omnichain applications

While cross-chain bridges can be easily built with MAP Protocol, the protocol itself targets a more fundamental problem and pursues a larger vision: empower Web3 applications to thrive in the omnichain future. Any Dapp built with MAP Protocol's infrastructure automatically inherits the omnichain nature of MAP Protocol without requiring the developers to tackle the error-prone cross-chain communications. 

MAP Protocol is the super connector of blockchains and will facilitate Web3 applications to onboard the next millions of users.
